# (Almost) Everything you need to be an Swift iOS developer 

I’ve only included the essentials in this guide. There is certainly more to say about each topic, but after 2 years of iOS development, these are the ideas that I feel are most important.

### Workflow: 

Use an external monitor! Xcode uses multiple panes and inspector windows that quickly crowd your actual coding space. Using a large external monitor will alleviate this issue and speed up your workflow considerably. 

### Misc advice:

Be careful when renaming/removing variables that are attached to storyboards via IBOutlets! If the connection is not also removed your app will crash and you will get a very cryptic “key" error that will take you hours to debug if you haven’t seen it before.

Unwrapping options (using !) is very dangerous. I know they’re tempting to use since they cut down on the amount of code you have to write. Unwrap with extreme caution and err on the safe side. On that note, learn when to use the ‘guard’ statement to unwrap as it can provide considerable code cleanliness improvements over ‘if let’.  

#### Segues

Segues are much, much cleaner if defined pragmatically. 

I personally don’t the PrepareForSegue paradigm. In my opinion is breaks the flow of the code by moving your segue logic to another location in the file. I also find the arrows generated by segues defined in the story board to generate a lot of clutter with more complicated applications. You can organize your storyboard in a logical way that makes the segues obvious. 

Here’s the flow I would recommend. 
‘’'swift
//I would recommend making this a static variable so you have access to it in all files across the lifecycle of the app for all segues
let mainSB = UIStoryboard(name: "Main", bundle: nil)

//make sure to set the identifier in storyboard
//note: unsafe unwrapping used to be concise. 
let destinationVC = mainStoryboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: “destination”) as! MyViewController

//pass through the information 
destination.someInteger = 5
destination.someString = “derp”

//make the segue
self.present(destinationVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
//or use "myNavController.pushViewController(destinationVC, animated: true)” when you’re in a navigation stack
‘''
